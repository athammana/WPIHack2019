# WPIHack2019

Hi There!

This is a hackathon project where we created a very simple app that creates dynamic alarms based on the users routine. You would set a list of tasks (brushing your teeth, showering and eating breakfast) with each of them having amounts of time for completion, and then the app will automagically set off alarms at the calculated times based on the time you start and the time you need to get out the door.

The app is currently non-functional, but thank you for visiting!
